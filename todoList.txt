make setProgressBar have dynamic values instead of static #s:
  socket.on('upgradeConfirmed', function (data) {

make re-login respect block so it doesn't unblock early... just like a fresh page load

figure out how to track upgrades applied... like core 1 upgrade max energy.
  todo: add other cases for this or rework how it does what it does

in logoutUser (sockets.js):
  //TODO: emit final update of all relevant data
  see other comments

fix undefined username in logout sendClicks
